		<p>The nesting habits of these birds are a bit unique. The male chooses a site in view of the female, selecting one stick and bringing it back, lays it in front of his mate.
		The female who stays at the nesting site accepts the sticks the male brings to her and places them underneath her.

		The nest of the these birds can be found along building ledges, rafters, beams, and under bridges or inside barns.

		The nest is saucer-like in shape and made of stems, and leaves.</p>
