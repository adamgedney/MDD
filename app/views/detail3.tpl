		<p>Pairs are monogamous, often breeding in consecutive seasons for as long as both birds of a pair live.


		Most will attempt to raise several broods each year. Sometimes as many as four or five broods will be raised in a single year.

		The breeding season of these birds can be all year provided climate conditions allow. There seems to be some slowing down during the winter months.</p>
