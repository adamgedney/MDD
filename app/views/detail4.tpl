		<p>The female may sit on the nest a day or two before the first egg is laid. Generally 2 white eggs are laid. Both the male and female will incubate the eggs although the female does the incubation during the night.

		Incubation last for about 18 days and the young will leave the nest in 25 to 29 days after hatching.

		Initially, the young are fed "milk" (regurgitated thick liquid food from the parents crops). Over a 10 day period the young are fed increasing amounts of solid food such as caterpillars.</p>
